Just use clone or Download Zip to get this code.

## How to run this (Either choose option 1 or 2)

1. Simpley open index.html in a browser.

2. Create a simple http server with python (Run below command after navigating into the folder which index.html belongs to). 

The advantage, I see with this, 2nd, method is [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) will just work. 
Otherwise, there is a small [configuration](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools#important-usage-notes) to do in Chrome.

Python 3.x
`python -m http.server`
OR
`python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Now, the output will be visible on http://localhost:8000/.

## Code intro

Most of Vue coding is in script.js

If this repo doesn't make sense, you can also learn vue.js like me at https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-js/. 
That's really good tutorial. I loved it. Based on that tutorial, I build this project. This is one study project only.
